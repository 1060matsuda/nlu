I found the when lammps reads the restart file, 
unfortunately time is reset to zero.

This time the variable "i" is modified, so that the time succeeds the former simulation.

-> the simulation stops for the same reason, at the similar timestep.

This time dump file will be created before the simulation collapses, and I'll check the morphology later.
